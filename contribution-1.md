User story

```gherkin=
Feature: Spraying
  As a user 
  I want to click & hold 
  So that I can place multiple briqs on the canvas, like “spraying”

  Scenario: User sprays briqs
    Given I am on the builder 
    And I am in “place mode”
    When I click & hold the left-click
    Then I can place multiple briqs
```
